# Hackathon Project  
**Using Machine Learning to Detect Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions**

## Overview  
This project was developed during a hackathon with the goal of leveraging machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing transaction data, we aim to provide a robust and efficient system to mitigate financial fraud.

## Key Features  
- **Data Analysis**: Explored transaction datasets for meaningful insights and patterns.  
- **Modeling**: Built and trained machine learning models for fraud detection.  
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

## Project Highlights  
- Applied supervised learning algorithms to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.  
- Implemented feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.  
- Visualized data distributions to understand transaction behavior.  

## How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
   python3 app.py
Here is the updated version of the `README.md` for your Hackathon project, reflecting the use of a **custom fictional dataset** generated using Python instead of a publicly available dataset:

### Library Installation  
To install the necessary libraries, run:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How It Works  
### 1. Data Generation (Custom Dataset)  
- The dataset is synthetically created using Python to simulate real-world credit card transaction data.  
- Features like transaction amount, merchant type, and time are randomly generated while maintaining realistic correlations between them.  
- A label (fraud or non-fraud) is assigned based on predefined rules, mimicking the way fraudulent transactions occur in practice.

### 2. Data Preprocessing  
- The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, scaling numeric features, and encoding categorical variables.  

### 3. Model Training  
- The `RandomForestClassifier` is used to train a model on the data.  
- The model is trained to classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **non-fraudulent** based on historical patterns.

### 4. Model Evaluation  
- The model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other classification metrics to assess its performance in predicting fraud.

## Running the Project  

### Steps to Run:  
1. **Generate the Dataset**:  
   - The synthetic dataset is generated by running the Python script `dataset.py`.  
   - The dataset will be saved as `synthetic_fraud_data_human_readable.csv`.  

2. **Train the Model**:  
   - Run the main script `train.py` to start the training process.  
   - The model will load the generated dataset and train a fraud detection model.  

3. **Run the server**:  
   - Run app.py.

### Example Commands to Run:  
```bash
python data.py    # Generate the synthetic dataset  
train.py            # Train the model and evaluate performance  
```

## Future Improvements  
- **Model Optimization**: Experiment with more advanced machine learning algorithms like XGBoost or Neural Networks.  
- **Real-Time Detection**: Implement real-time transaction monitoring for fraud detection.  
- **Additional Features**: Integrate more features like user transaction history, device fingerprinting, etc.  
- **Deployment**: Deploy the model into a web-based or cloud service for real-time fraud detection.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Custom Dataset**: I've added a section explaining that the dataset is **synthetically generated** using Python to simulate transaction data. This is done to avoid privacy issues found in real-world datasets, which often anonymize sensitive details.
- **Data Generation and Preprocessing**: Explained how the dataset is generated and the steps involved in data preprocessing, including feature encoding and handling.
- **Steps to Run**: Clarified the commands and scripts you need to run, including the dataset generation script (`generate_synthetic_data.py`) and the model training script (`fraud_detection.py`).

This `README.md` is now tailored to reflect the use of a custom dataset and provides a full outline of the project structure, future improvements, and running instructions. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
