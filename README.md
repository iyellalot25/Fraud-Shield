# Hackathon Project  
**Using Machine Learning to Detect Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions**

## Overview  
This project was developed during a hackathon with the goal of leveraging machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing transaction data, we aim to provide a robust and efficient system to mitigate financial fraud.

## Key Features  
- **Data Analysis**: Explored transaction datasets for meaningful insights and patterns.  
- **Modeling**: Built and trained machine learning models for fraud detection.  
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

## Project Highlights  
- Applied supervised learning algorithms to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.  
- Implemented feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.  
- Visualized data distributions to understand transaction behavior.
